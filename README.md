# Wavelet-based density estimators in Python

This package implements the simple estimator based on average of wavelet functions
at sample points, and two shape-preserving based on estimating the square root
and then squaring it. The first using a pre-estimator of the square root and the
second based on k-nearest neighbours. In all cases, the estimators are for multivariate
data on the $[0,1]^d$ cube. If the data is not in that range, one can always
rescale.
